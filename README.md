# Princeton Algorithms Part 1 - 8 Puzzle 

Problem:
The 8-puzzle is a classic sliding puzzle played on a 3Ã—3 grid, consisting of eight numbered tiles and one blank space. The objective is to rearrange the tiles into row-major order by sliding them horizontally or vertically into the blank space, using as few moves as possible.

Solution:
In this project, I built a board to simulate the 8-puzzle and developed a solver using a priority-based search algorithm. The solver efficiently finds the optimal sequence of moves to complete the puzzle in the fewest steps possible.

Result:
Successfully completed the project with a score of 94%.
