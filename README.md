# Princeton Algorithms Part 1 - 8 Puzzle 

The problem: The 8-puzzle is a sliding puzzle that is played on a 3-by-3 grid with 8 square tiles labeled 1 through 8, plus a blank square. The goal is to rearrange the tiles so that they are in row-major order, using as few moves as possible. You are permitted to slide tiles either horizontally or vertically into the blank square. </br>

Solution: In this project, I created a board to stimulate an 8 puzzle. Then, I implemented the solver by creating a search function with a priority to solve the game in the least possible amount of moves. </br>

Passed with a score of 94%.
